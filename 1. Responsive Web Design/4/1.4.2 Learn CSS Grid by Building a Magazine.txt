##LEARN CSS GRID BY BUILDING A MAGAZINE
Completion Date: 5 Jul 2023

## Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an html element specifying this page is in English, a head element, and a body element.
Add a <meta> tag with the appropriate charset and a <meta> tag for mobile responsiveness within the head element.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

```

## Step 2
Add a title element with the text Magazine, a link element for the https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton%7CBaskervville%7CRaleway&display=swap font stylesheet, a link for the https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css FontAwesome stylesheet, and a link for your ./styles.css stylesheet.
Your font stylesheet will load three separate fonts: Anton, Baskervville, and Raleway.
```
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Magazine</title>
    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton%7CBaskervville%7CRaleway&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet"/>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css"/>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>

```

## Step 3
Within your body, create a main element. Then in that element, create a section with a class set to heading.
```
    <main>
      <section class="heading"></section>
    </main>

```

## Step 4
Within your .heading element, create a header element with the class set to hero.
In that element, create an img element with the src set to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png, the alt set to freecodecamp logo, and the class set to hero-img.
The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.
Give your new img element a loading attribute set to lazy.
```
    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img class="hero-img" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png" alt="freecodecamp logo" loading="lazy"/>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>

```

## Step 5
After your img element, add an h1 element with the class set to hero-title and the text set to OUR NEW CURRICULUM, followed by a p element with the class set to hero-subtitle and the text set to Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus.
```
    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based focus</p>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>

```

## Step 6
Your image currently takes up a lot of space. To better see what you are working on, add a width attribute to the img element, with a value of 400.
You will remove this later on when you have worked on the CSS.
```
    <main>
      <section class="heading">
        <header class="hero">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img" width="400"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">
            Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based
            focus
          </p>
        </header>
      </section>
    </main>

```

## Step 7
After your header element, create a div with the class set to author.
Within that div, create a p element with the class set to author-name and give it the text By freeCodeCamp. Wrap the freeCodeCamp portion in an a element with the href set to https://freecodecamp.org, and the target set to _blank.
Below that, add a second p element with the class publish-date and the text March 7, 2019.
```
        <div class="author">
          <p class="author-name">
            By
            <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
              >freeCodeCamp</a>
          </p>
          <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>

```

## Step 8
The Referer HTTP header contains information about the address or URL of a page that a user might be visiting from. This information can be used in analytics to track how many users from your page visit freecodecamp.org, for example. Setting the rel attribute to noreferrer omits this information from the HTTP request. Give your a element a rel attribute set to noreferrer.
```
        <div class="author">
          <p class="author-name">
            By
            <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
               rel="noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a
            >
          </p>
          <p class="publish-date">March 7, 2019</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>

```

## Step 9
Below your .author element, create a new div element with the class social-icons.
Add five a elements within that new div, and give them the following href attributes.
	•	The first a element should have an href set to https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp.
	•	The second a element should have an href set to https://twitter.com/freecodecamp.
	•	The third a element should have an href set to https://instagram.com/freecodecamp.
	•	The fourth a element should have an href set to https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp.
	•	The fifth a element should have an href set to https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp.
```
<div class="social-icons">
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://instagram.com/freecodecamp"></a>
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp"></a>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp"></a>
</div>

```

## Step 10
Within each of your new a elements, add an i element and give them the following classes:
	•	Your first i element should have the class fab fa-facebook-f
	•	Your second i element should have the class fab fa-twitter
	•	Your third i element should have the class fab fa-instagram
	•	Your fourth i element should have the class fab fa-linkedin-in
	•	Your fifth i element should have the class fab fa-youtube
```
        <div class="social-icons">
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freecodecamp/">
          <i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></a>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/freecodecamp/">
          <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a>
          <a href="https://instagram.com/freecodecamp">
          <i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/free-code-camp/">
          <i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp">
          <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i></a>
        </div>

```

## Step 11
Below your .heading element, create a new section element with the class set to text. Within that, create a p element with the class set to first-paragraph and the following text:
Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-drive
```
<section class="text">
  <p class="first-paragraph">Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
</p>
</section>

```

## Step 12
Create another p element below your .first-paragraph element, and give it the following text:
After years - years - of pondering these two problems and 
```
      <section class="text">
        <p class="first-paragraph">
          Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
</p>
      </section>

```

## Step 13
Add a third p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text:
It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)
```
        <p>It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

</p>

```

## Step 14
After the three p elements within your .text element, create a blockquote element. Within that, add an hr element, a p element with the class set to quote, and a second hr element.
Give the .quote element the text The entire curriculum should be a series of projects.
```
<blockquote>
  <hr>
    <p class="quote">The entire curriculum should be a series of projects</p>
  </hr>
  <hr></hr>
</blockquote>

```

## Step 15
Below your blockquote element, add another p element with the following text:
No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.

```
        <p>No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up a working project.

And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.
</p>

```

## Step 16
Create a fifth p element at the end of your .text element, and give it the following text:
The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
```

</p>

```

## Step 17
Create one final p element at the end of your .text element and give it the following text:
Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code
editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project.
People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they
experience when they build the required projects at the end of each
certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from
the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

      </section>

```

## Step 18
Below your .text element, create a new section element and give it a class of text text-with-images. Within that, create an article element with a class set to brief-history, and an aside element with the class set to image-wrapper.
```
<section class="text text-with-images">
  <article class="brief-history"></article>
  <aside class="image-wrapper"></aside>
</section>

```

## Step 19
Within your article element, create an h3 element with the class set to list-title and the text of A Brief History. Below that, create a p element with the text Of the Curriculum. Then create a ul element with the class lists.
```
        <article class="brief-history">
          <h3 class="list-title">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
          <ul class="lists"></ul>
        </article>

```

## Step 20
Within your ul element, create six li elements. Add an h4 element with a class set to list-subtitle and a p element to each of your li elements.
Then give the h4 and p elements the following text content, in order, with each h4 using what's on the left side of the colon, and each p using what's on the right:
	•	V1 - 2014: We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
	•	V2 - 2015: We added interactive algorithm challenges.
	•	V3 - 2015: We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).
	•	V4 - 2016: We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.
	•	V5 - 2017: We added the back end and data visualization challenges.
	•	V6 - 2018: We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
```
          <ul class="lists">
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.

              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying
                on General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This
                was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

```

## Step 21
Within your aside element, create two img elements, a blockquote element, and a third img element. Give the blockquote element a class set to image-quote.
```
        <aside class="image-wrapper">
          <img></img>
          <img></img>
          <blockquote class="image-quote"></blockquote>
          <img></img>
        </aside>

```

## Step 22
Within the .image-wrapper element, give your first img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/random-quote-machine.png, an alt of image of the quote machine project, a class of image-1, a loading attribute set to lazy, a width attribute of 600, and a height attribute of 400.
```
        <aside class="image-wrapper">
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/random-quote-machine.png"  alt="image of the quote machine project" class="image-1" loading="lazy" width="600" height="400"/>
          <img />
          <blockquote class="image-quote"></blockquote>
          <img />
        </aside>

```

## Step 23
Within your .image-wrapper element, give the second img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/calc.png, an alt of image of a calculator project, a loading attribute set to lazy, a class set to image-2, a width attribute set to 400, and a height attribute set to 400.
```
        <aside class="image-wrapper">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/random-quote-machine.png"
            alt="image of the quote machine project"
            loading="lazy"
            class="image-1"
            width="600"
            height="400"
          />
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/calc.png" alt="image of a calculator project" loading="lazy" class="image-2" width="400" height="400"/>
          <blockquote class="image-quote"></blockquote>
          <img />
        </aside>

```

## Step 24
Within your .image-wrapper element, give your third img element a src of https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg, an alt of four people working on code, a loading attribute of lazy, a class set to image-3, a width attribute set to 600, and a height attribute set to 400.
```
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg" alt="four people working on code" loading="lazy" class="image-3" width="600" height="400"/>

```

## Step 25
Within your .image-quote element, nest an hr element, a p element and a second hr element. Give the p element a class set to quote and the text The millions of people who are learning to code through freeCodeCamp will have an even better resource to help them learn these fundamentals..
```
          <blockquote class="image-quote">
            <hr></hr>
            <p class="quote">The millions of people who are learning to code through freeCodeCamp will have an even better resource to help them learn these fundamentals.</p>
            <hr></hr>
          </blockquote>

```

## Step 26
To start your CSS, normalize the CSS rules by targeting all elements with *, including the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors.
Set the padding and margin properties both to 0 and set the box-sizing property to border-box.
```
*, ::before, ::after {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

```

## Step 27
Create an html selector and give it a font-size property set to 62.5%. This will set the default font size for your web page to 10px (the browser default is 16px).
This will make it easier for you to work with rem units later, as 2rem would be 20px.
```
html {
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

```

## Step 28
Create a body selector. Set the font-family property to Baskervville, with a fallback of serif. Set the color property to linen and the background-color property to rgb(20, 30, 40).
```
body {
  font-family: Baskervville, serif;
  color: linen;
  background-color: rgb(20, 30, 40);
}

```

## Step 29
Create an h1 selector, and set the font-family property to Anton with the fallback of sans-serif.
```
h1 {
  font-family: Anton, sans-serif;
}

```

## Step 30
Create an h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 selector. Give it a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif.
```
h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: Raleway, sans-serif;
}

```

## Step 31
Create an a selector, and give it a text-decoration property set to none and a color property set to linen.
```
a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: linen;
}

```

## Step 32
Now you are ready to start putting together the grid layout. CSS Grid offers a two-dimensional grid-based layout, allowing you to center items horizontally and vertically while still retaining control to do things like overlap elements.
Begin by creating a main selector and giving it a display property set to grid.
```
main {
  display: grid;
}

```

## Step 33
Now you can style the layout of your grid. CSS Grid is similar to Flexbox in that it has a special property for both the parent and child elements.
In this case, your parent element is the main element. Set the content to have a three-column layout by adding a grid-template-columns property with a value of 1fr 94rem 1fr. This will create three columns where the middle column is 94rem wide, and the first and last columns are both 1 fraction of the remaining space in the grid container.

```
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr;
}

```

## Step 34
Use the minmax function to make your columns responsive on any device. The minmax function takes two arguments, the first being the minimum value and the second being the maximum. These values could be a length, percentage, fr, or even a keyword like max-content.
Wrap each of your already defined values of the grid-template-columns property in a minmax function, using each value as the second argument. The first argument should be 2rem, min-content, and 2rem respectively.
```
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(2rem, 1fr) minmax(min-content, 94rem) minmax(2rem, 1fr)
}

```

## Step 35
To add space between rows in the grid layout, you can use the row-gap property. Give the main selector a row-gap property of 3rem.
```
main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: minmax(2rem, 1fr) minmax(min-content, 94rem) minmax(2rem, 1fr);
  row-gap: 3rem;
}

```

## Step 36
Your magazine will have three primary sections. You already set the overall layout in the main rule, but you can adjust the placement in the child rules.
One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.
Create a .heading rule and set the grid-column property to 2 / 3. This will tell the .heading element to start at grid line 2 and end at grid line 3
```
.heading {
  grid-column:2 / 3; 
}

```

## Step 37
Create a .text selector and give it a grid-column property set to 2 / 3.
```
.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
}

```

## Step 38
For additional control over the layout of your content, you can have a CSS Grid within a CSS Grid.
Set the display property of your .heading selector to grid.

```
.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
}

```

## Step 39
Now you can style the content of the .heading element with CSS Grid.
The CSS repeat() function is used to repeat a value, rather than writing it out manually, and is helpful for grid layouts. For example, setting the grid-template-columns property to repeat(20, 200px) would create 20 columns each 200px wide.
Give your .heading element a grid-template-columns property set to repeat(2, 1fr) to create two columns of equal width.

```
.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2,1fr);
}

```

## Step 40
Give your .heading selector a row-gap property set to 1.5rem.
```
.heading {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  row-gap: 1.5rem;
}

```

## Step 41
Remember that the grid-column property determines which columns an element starts and ends at. There may be times where you are unsure of how many columns your grid will have, but you want an element to stop at the last column. To do this, you can use -1 for the end column.
Create a .hero selector and give it a grid-column property set to 1 / -1. This will tell the element to span the full width of the grid.

```
.hero {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}

```

## Step 42
Give the .hero selector a position property set to relative.
```
.hero {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  position: relative;
}

```

## Step 43
You should remove the temporary width attribute before writing the CSS for your .hero-img.
```
          <img
            src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_meta_1920X1080-indigo.png"
            alt="freecodecamp logo"
            loading="lazy"
            class="hero-img"
          />
          <h1 class="hero-title">OUR NEW CURRICULUM</h1>
          <p class="hero-subtitle">
            Our efforts to restructure our curriculum with a more project-based
            focus
          </p>

```

## Step 44
Create an img selector and give it a width property set to 100%, and an object-fit property set to cover.
The object-fit property tells the browser how to position the element within its container. In this case, cover will set the image to fill the container, cropping as needed to avoid changing the aspect ratio.

```
img {
  width: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}

```

## Step 45
Create a .hero-title selector and give it a text-align property set to center, a color property set to orangered and a font-size property set to 8rem.
```
.hero-title {
  text-align: center;
  color: orangered;
  font-size: 8rem;
}

```

## Step 46
The subtitle also needs to be styled. Create a .hero-subtitle selector and give it a font-size property set to 2.4rem, a color property set to orangered, and a text-align property set to center.
```
.hero-subtitle {
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  color: orangered;
  text-align: center;
}

```

## Step 47
Create an .author selector and give it a font-size property set to 2rem and a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif.
```
.author {
  font-size: 2rem;
  font-family: Raleway, sans-serif;
}

```

## Step 48
Create a .author-name a:hover selector and give it a background-color property set to #306203.
This will create a hover effect only for the a element within the .author-name, showing the original freeCodeCamp green in the background.

```
.author-name a: hover{
  background-color: #306203;
}

```

## Step 49
Create a .publish-date selector and give it a color property of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5).
```
.publish-date {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}

```

## Step 50
Create a .social-icons selector. Give it a display property set to grid, and a font-size property set to 3rem.
```
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
}

```

## Step 51
The default settings for CSS Grid will create additional rows as needed, unlike Flexbox. Give the .social-icons selector a grid-template-columns property set to repeat(5, 1fr) to arrange the icons in a single row.
```
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5,1fr)
```

## Step 52
If you wanted to add more social icons, but keep them on the same row, you would need to update grid-template-columns to create additional columns. As an alternative, you can use the grid-auto-flow property.
This property takes either row or column as the first value, with an optional second value of dense. grid-auto-flow uses an auto-placement algorithm to adjust the grid layout. Setting it to column will tell the algorithm to create new columns for content as needed. The dense value allows the algorithm to backtrack and fill holes in the grid with smaller items, which can result in items appearing out of order.
For your .social-icons selector, set the grid-auto-flow property to column.

```
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;

```

## Step 53
Now the auto-placement algorithm will kick in when you add a new icon element. However, the algorithm defaults the new column width to be auto, which will not match your current columns.
You can override this with the grid-auto-columns property. Give the .social-icons selector a grid-auto-columns property set to 1fr.

```
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
}

```

## Step 54
Much like Flexbox, with CSS Grid you can align the content of grid items with align-items and justify-items. align-items will align child elements along the column axis, and justify-items will align child elements along the row axis.
Give the .social-icons selector an align-items property set to center.

```
.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
  align-items: center;
}

```

## Step 55
Give the .text selector a font-size property set to 1.8rem and a letter-spacing property set to 0.6px.
```
.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
}

```

## Step 56
our .text element is not a CSS Grid, but you can create columns within an element without using Grid by using the column-width property.
Give your .text selector a column-width property set to 25rem.

```
.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
}

```

## Step 57
Magazines often use justified text in their printed content to structure their layout and control the flow of their content. While this works in printed form, justified text on websites can be an accessibility concern, for example presenting challenges for folks with dyslexia.
To make your project look like a printed magazine, give the .text selector a text-align property set to justify.

```
.text {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  letter-spacing: 0.6px;
  column-width: 25rem;
  text-align: justify;
}

```

## Step 58
The ::first-letter pseudo-selector allows you to target the first letter in the text content of an element.
Create a .first-paragraph::first-letter selector and set the font-size property to 6rem. Also give it a color property set to orangered to make it stand out.

```
.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
}

```

## Step 59
The other text has been shifted out of place. Move it into position by giving the .first-paragraph::first-letter selector a float property set to left and a margin-right property set to 1rem.
```
.first-paragraph::first-letter {
  font-size: 6rem;
  color: orangered;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

```

## Step 60
Create an hr selector, and give it a margin property set to 1.5rem 0.
```
hr {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
}

```

## Step 61
To give the hr a color, you need to adjust the border property. Give the hr selector a border property set to 1px solid rgba(120, 120, 120, 0.6).
```
hr {
  margin: 1.5rem 0;
  border: 1px solid rgba(120, 120, 120, 0.6);
}

```

## Step 62
Create a .quote selector. Give it a color property set to #00beef, a font-size property set to 2.4rem, and a text-align property set to center.
```
.quote {
  color: #00beef;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  text-align: center;
}

```

## Step 63
To make the quote text stand out more, give the .quote selector a font-family property set to Raleway with a fallback of sans-serif.
```
.quote {
  color: #00beef;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: Raleway, sans-serif;
}

```

## Step 64
A quote is not really a quote without proper quotation marks. You can add these with CSS pseudo selectors.
Create a .quote::before selector and set the content property to " with a space following it.
Also, create a .quote::after selector and set the content property to " with a space preceding it.

```
.quote::before {
  content:'" ';
}

.quote::after {
  content:' "';
}

```

## Step 65
Now it's time to style your third section. Note that it has the text and text-with-images values for the class attribute, which means it is already inheriting the styles from your .text rule.
Create a .text-with-images selector and set the display property to grid.

```
.text-with-images {
  display: grid; 
}

```

## Step 66
You will need to have a column for text and a column for images. Give the .text-with-images selector a grid-template-columns property set to 1fr 2fr. Also set the column-gap property to 3rem to provide more spacing between the columns.
```
.text-with-images {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  column-gap: 3rem;
}

```

## Step 67
Give the .text-with-images selector a margin-bottom property set to 3rem.
```
.text-with-images {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  column-gap: 3rem;
  margin-bottom: 3rem;
}

```

## Step 68
Create a .lists selector and set the list-style-type property to none. This will get rid of the bullet points on the list items.
```
.lists {
  list-style-type: none;
}

```

## Step 69
Give the .lists selector a margin-top property set to 2rem.
```
.lists {
  list-style-type: none;
  margin-top: 2rem;
}

```

## Step 70
Create a .lists li rule to target the list items within your .lists element. Give it a margin-bottom property set to 1.5rem.
```
.lists li {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem
}

```

## Step 71
Create a .list-title, .list-subtitle selector and set the color property to #00beef.
```
.list-title, .list-subtitle {
  color: #00beef;
}

```

## Step 72
Time to style the last section of the magazine - the images.
The images are wrapped with an aside element using the image-wrapper class, so create an .image-wrapper selector. Set the display property to grid.

```
.image-wrapper {
  display:grid;
}

```

## Step 73
The images should be within a two column, three row layout.
Give the .image-wrapper selector a grid-template-columns property set to 2fr 1fr and a grid-template-rows property set to repeat(3, min-content). This will give our grid rows that adjust in height based on the content, but columns that remain a fixed width based on the container.

```
.image-wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, min-content);
}

```

## Step 74
The gap property is a shorthand way to set the value of column-gap and row-gap at the same time. If given one value, it sets the column-gap and row-gap both to that value. If given two values, it sets the row-gap to the first value and the column-gap to the second.
Give the .image-wrapper selector a gap property set to 2rem.

```
.image-wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, min-content);
  gap: 2rem;
}

```

## Step 75
The place-items property can be used to set the align-items and justify-items values at the same time. The place-items property takes one or two values. If one value is provided, it is used for both the align-items and justify-items properties. If two values are provided, the first value is used for the align-items property and the second value is used for the justify-items property.
Give the .image-wrapper selector a place-items property set to center.

```
.image-wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, min-content);
  gap: 2rem;
  place-items: center;
}

```

## Step 76
Create an .image-1, .image-3 rule and give it a grid-column property set to 1 / -1. This will allow the first and third images to span the full width of the grid.
```
.image-1, .image-3 {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
}

```

## Step 77
Now that the magazine layout is finished, you need to make it responsive.
Start with a @media query for only screen with a max-width of 720px. Inside, create an .image-wrapper selector and give it a grid-template-columns property of 1fr.
This will collapse the three images into one column on smaller screens.

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 720px) {
  .image-wrapper {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

```

## Step 78
Create another @media query for only screen with a max-width of 600px. Within, create a .text-with-images rule and give it a grid-template-columns property of 1fr.
This will collapse your bottom text area into a single column on smaller screens.
```
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .text-with-images {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}

```

## Step 79
Create a third @media query for only screen with a max-width of 550px. Within, create a .hero-title selector with a font-size set to 6rem, a .hero-subtitle, .author, .quote, .list-title selector with a font-size set to 1.8rem, a .social-icons selector with a font-size set to 2rem, and a .text selector with a font-size set to 1.6rem.
```
@media only screen and (max-width: 550px) {
  .hero-title {
    font-size: 6rem;
  }
  .hero-subtitle, .author, .quote, .list-title {
    font-size: 1.8rem;
  }
  .social-icons {
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  .text {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
  }
}

```

## Step 80
Create one final @media query for only screen with a max-width of 420px. Within, create a .hero-title selector with a font-size property set to 4.5rem.
Congratulations! Your magazine is now complete.

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 420px)  {
    .hero-title {
    font-size: 4.5rem;
  }
}
```

          Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It
          just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <hr />
          <p class="quote">
            The entire curriculum should be a series of projects
          </p>
          <hr />
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one
          test at a time, as you build up a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has plenty of repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from "reading mode" to "coding mode".
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test after another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to what they experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification. They'll get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a much smoother experience.

              <p>
                We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources,
                including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
              <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
              <p>
                We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on
                General Assembly's Dash course for these).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
              <p>
                We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front
                End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required
                projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges.
                For the other certs, we were still using external resources like
                Node School.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
              <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
              <p>
                We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was
                the biggest curriculum improvement to date.
